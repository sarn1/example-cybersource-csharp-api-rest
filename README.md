<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Example Code For Posting to CyberSource Web API

This is sample code to show you how to post to CyberSource web APIs.  This sample is posting to the development environment at `https://apitest.cybersource.com`  From this code, you will be able to create the request headers that is needed in order for your calls to be authorized.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You will need to have your merchant Id, secret key, and key Id all ready.  

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The codebase is in .NET Core, since at this time the CyberSource Rest API SDK only works in .NET Framework.  I'm assuming, most people who will find this sample code useful are those on .NET Core.  Please note that this code is ONLY for development.  **It is NOT production ready code.**  Please refactor accordingly.
